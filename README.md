## 📌 What is NativeComponents?

**NativeComponents** is not a UI library — it's a **community-driven platform** where developers share fully-functional **React Native components** in their **raw, editable form**.

> No installation. No dependency hell. Just copy the component folder into your project and start building.

Inspired by platforms like [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui), this project encourages developers to **contribute, explore, and reuse** high-quality components without being locked into any specific library.

## 🎯 Our Goals

- 📁 **Component-first**: Every component lives in its own isolated folder with all related files
- 🤲 **Open contributions**: Anyone can contribute their React Native components
- 📤 **Easy sharing**: Add your component, write a short README, and publish to the platform
- 🚫 **No vendor lock-in**: Components are copy-paste friendly, not tied to a package or dependency

## 💬 Why NativeComponents?

Building reusable components is hard — sharing them shouldn’t be.  
This project aims to **make it easy for developers to share and use React Native components without friction**.

You write a component → You share it → Someone else benefits from it. That’s it.
